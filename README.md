# LexmanCAD
Information on LexmanCAD apps, how to contribute, and get the source code.

## About
LexmanCAD was a weekend project that I started while in school to expand some AutoCAD 2013 functionality. Somehow, these tools wound up doing pretty well on the AutoCAD app store. I think this is mostly because they solve some little but real annoyances that CAD developers deal with day in and day out. I've long left the AutoCAD scene, but, I'm hoping that by open sourcing this, the code can live on and be updated for more recent versions of Autodesk products.
